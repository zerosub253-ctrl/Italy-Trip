## Selected Design: Mediterranean Minimalism

I've chosen **Mediterranean Minimalism** for this project. This approach creates a warm, inviting interface that celebrates Italian heritage while maintaining clarity and usability. The asymmetric timeline with organic dividers will make the preparation journey feel natural and progressive, while the warm terracotta and sage palette evokes the beauty of Italy itself.

The design emphasizes:
- **Clarity**: Clean layout with generous whitespace
- **Warmth**: Mediterranean color palette that feels personal
- **Progressive disclosure**: Information revealed as needed
- **Delight**: Satisfying animations that reward task completion
